# hello-world

What up,
  Started learning to code just for fun in the beginning of quarantine. Half way through, girlfriend got promoted and now we need to move cross country (which im not mad about trust me). I have a decent paying career, but can't travel with it so looking for a career change. Now im taking coding more seriously to try and get a job in the field by Oct. 2020. Will be posting up projects and visions as i get them finished.
